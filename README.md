Event Hive is a modern, feature-rich Android application for discovering, creating, and managing local events. Built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it provides a seamless, real-time experience for both event organizers and attendees, complete with a dynamic map, user authentication, and a secure (test mode) ticket booking flow.

This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate a full-stack mobile development process, incorporating a clean MVVM architecture, a live Firebase backend, and a professional, user-centric UI.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Event Creation & Discovery:** Users can create their own events, including details, images, and ticket information, which are instantly saved to a live cloud database.

* **Cloud-Based Image Hosting:** Integration with **Cloudinary** for robust, cloud-based image hosting and delivery, ensuring fast and efficient media handling.
* **Dynamic Map View:** An interactive map screen built with **osmdroid** that displays events near the user based on a custom discovery radius set in their profile.
* **Location Autocomplete & Geo-querying:** Smart location search powered by Android's Geocoder and a custom-built geo-querying system to find nearby events.
* **Secure Ticket Booking Flow:** A complete, end-to-end ticket booking system that uses a **Firebase Cloud Function** to securely create payment orders with **Razorpay**.
* **Modern, Declarative UI:** The entire user interface is built with **Jetpack Compose**, following Material Design principles for a clean, intuitive, and responsive experience.
* **Clean Architecture:** The app is architected using the **MVVM pattern** (ViewModel, Repository) with StateFlow for reactive state management, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, you will need to set up your own Firebase, Cloudinary, and Razorpay credentials.

**Prerequisites:**
* Android Studio (latest version recommended)
* A Firebase project
* A Cloudinary account
* A Razorpay account (in Test Mode)

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/imcoolthanyou/Event_Hive.git](https://github.com/imcoolthanyou/Event_Hive.git)
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Open the cloned project in Android Studio.

3.  **Firebase Setup:**
    * Go to your Firebase project console.
    * Add a new Android app with the package name `gautam.projects.event_hive`.
    * Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app/` directory of the project.

4.  **API Keys Setup:**
    * In the main package (`app/src/main/java/gautam/projects/event_hive/`), create a new Kotlin file named `ApiKeys.kt`.
    * Add your Cloudinary and Razorpay credentials to this file. **This file is included in `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure.**
        ```kotlin
        package gautam.projects.event_hive

        object ApiKeys {
            // Cloudinary
            const val CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = "YOUR_CLOUD_NAME_HERE"
            const val CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
            const val CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = "YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE"

            // Razorpay (Test Mode)
            const val RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID = "YOUR_TEST_KEY_ID_HERE"
        }
        ```

5.  **Build and Run:** Build the project in Android Studio. It should now run on your emulator or physical device.
